In this sample you will implement a grocery store cash register.  Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill.  Items are priced a few of different ways:
               
- A given price for each item, e.g. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each
- A given price by weight, e.g. Apples are $2.49 per pound
- Items can be go on sale where you might receive bulk discounts, e.g. Buy two get one free sales are also available
- Coupons are available to get money off the bill when the total amount is above a threshold, e.g. $5 off when you spend $100 or more
